Description: Symphony is an algorithm to enable rapid single-cell reference mapping. Symphony compression takes in a harmonized reference and outputs the minimal reference elements needed to map a new query. Symphony mapping takes in query gene expression and maps the cells into the harmonized reference embedding, which can power downstream visualization and inference tasks.
